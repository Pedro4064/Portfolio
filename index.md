## Welcome to my Portfolio

### About me

My name is Pedro Henrique Limeira da Cruz, I was born in January 30, 2002 in the Brazilian city of Canoas, in the
state of Rio Grande do Sul.
	The greater portion of my life I lived in the Brazilian Capital Brasília, but when I was X years old I moved to the 
United States of America, where I lived for one year and a half on Maryland, and attended Tilden Middle School, where I 
graduated middle school.
	When I came back to Brazil I moved back to Brasília and attended the military school of Brasília (cmb) where I joined
the Marching Band, the Foreign Relations Club, Robotics Club, and the Literary and Recreational Society.
